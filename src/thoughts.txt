- king tags obstacles: these become sources of income
- engineer can touch an obstacle and construct a tower. Towers will lose range over time and eventually just melt
- engineer can also touch an existing friendly tower and extend its radius and life
- general can spend money to spawn creeps
- Creeps chase kings and take down their HP (0 HP = gg). Creeps also slowly melt.
- Towers shoot down creeps
- Towers repel generals

New ideas:
- An obstacle can have a tower or a source of income -- not both
- Different obstacles have different rates and totals of resources, once the total is used up the minerals are gone
- Only the King can see the output of an obstacle, by getting close to it
- Obstacles in the middle tend to have higher rates and totals
- King touches an obstacle to establish a mine (only if there's no tower): this generates a rate of resources until it's all used up
- Optional: King can stay and increase the output of a mine (up to the maximum)
- Any unit including creeps can destroy enemy mines simply by touching them, but they can be re-established -- by either team!
- Engineer touches an obstacle to establish a tower: this destroys any pre-existing mine
