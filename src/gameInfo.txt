Input is given as follows:
Your health
Your resources
Enemy health
Enemy resources
Number of units (N)
N lines of 6 integers
id playerId unitType x y extra
-----------
playerId is 0 if it's yours or 1 if it's enemy or -1 if not owned

unitType:
0 - King
1 - Engineer
2 - General
3 - Resource

Extra is health for spawned units and towers (placeholder otherwise)



Rules of Game:

General can spawn units on neighboring squares (only one at a time not like the other version but no cooldown and lower cost)
Engineer will heal all towers within 1 distance automatically (Maybe this is too over powered and needs to be a move?).
It can also build towers on certain spots. The only
places where towers can be built are where resources used to exist or where they already exist. If building onto a
resource the resource is destroyed. (Perhaps building onto resource gives health boost?)
King can move around and harvest resources.
Units with speed x can move up to x squares away. Diagonal moves are allowed and count as one move. Units with a speed
of greater than one do not travel from square to square, they jump to destination (no intermediate collisions)
If after all moves are done and two units occupy the same square they are moved back to starting position




------------

Possible Outputs:
3 lines of output - one each for the main units

Output in order: King, Engineer, General

MOVE X Y - this is applicable to all units, simply move - player dies if too far away (not possible location)
HARVEST X Y - harvest the resource at this location - must be King unit - player dies if no resource at this loc or if
not neighboring unit
BUILD X Y - build tower at this location - must be engineer unit - player dies if not buildable spot or if not enough
resources to build tower
SPAWN X Y minionType - spawn minion at this location - must be general unit - player dies if spawn loc is not neighboring
to General, if there is not enough resources to spawn minion, or if minionType is not valid

--------
Order of moves:

Spawn moves are carried out (creating minions or not if two spawns occur in same location)
Harvests are carried out giving resources to players and removing resource
Towers are built (they will not act the first turn they are built)
All moves are carried out (Spawned minions move, main units move) and if collisions they are reset to original position
Engineer does heal to towers (don't clamp max health yet)
Towers and minions do damage (remember towers that were created this turn do not do damage)
Check and destroy dead units, check for end game
Clamp values such as health
