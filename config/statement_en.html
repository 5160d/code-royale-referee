            <p>
                The game is played by two players on a semi-open two-dimensional field <const>1920</const> units wids and <const>950</const> units wide, littered with circular obstacles of varying radius.<br>
                Each player controls a single Queen character, who can establish different structures on those obstacles.<br>
                <br>
                The field is generated randomly every game, with the obstacles being symmetrically laid out.<br>
            </p>

            <!-- BEGIN wood3 wood2 -->
            <!-- END -->

            <p><strong>Queens</strong><br>
                <br>
                The Queen is the player’s only way to directly interact with the field.<br>
                The Queen is modeled as a circle with radius 20 units, and moves up to 60 units every turn.<br>
                Queen characters each start with 200 HP, and will be destroyed if this drops to zero -- if this happens, the player will lose the game.<br>
                <br>
                If both Queens are destroyed in the same turn, the game will end in a draw.<br>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Structures</strong><br>
                <br>
                A Queen character can build a structure on an obstacle that she is in contact with.<br>
                If she so chooses, a Queen can replace an existing friendly structure simply by building another one in its place.<br>
                If an enemy structure is already in place on an obstacle, a Queen cannot replace it.<br>
                If both Queens try simultaneously to build a structure on the same obstacle, neither structure will be built.<br>
                <br>
                Structures can be built at no cost, and are available for use on the turn immediately following their construction.<br>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Mining</strong><br>
                <br>
                Players will need mineral resources to win.<br>
                A Queen can establish a resource mine on an obstacle by issuing the command BUILD MINE while touching an obstacle, or using the command BUILDONOBSTACLE {id} MINE to move toward an obstacle and build a mine when touching that obstacle.<br>
                <br>
                Each obstacle has a different rate at which resources can be collected, ranging from +1/turn to +5/turn.<br>
                Once a mine is established, resources will accumulate in the player’s bank over several turns.<br>
                However, the obstacle will be exhausted of resources over time (all obstacles begin the game with the same amount).<br>
                <br>
                A mine will be destroyed if:
                <ul>
                    <li>It runs out of resources</li>
                    <li>An enemy creep comes in contact with it</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Creeps</strong><br>
                <br>
                In order to destroy the enemy Queen, a player will need to build creeps.<br>
                Once built, creeps follow very simple behaviours (see below), and cannot be controlled by the player.<br>
                Creeps will eventually age and die on their own, losing 1HP every turn.<br>
                <br>
                There are three different creep types that can be built.<br>

                </table>

                <br>
                MELEE units are light, fast units which attack the enemy Queen, dealing 1 damage every turn they end contacting the enemy Queen.<br>
                RANGED units are slower, ranged units which move toward and attack nearby enemy creeps from a short distance.<br>
                They deal 1 damage to the their nearest enemy creep every turn they end within range of that creep. (Note: they can shoot past obstacles).<br>
                GIANT units do not attack the enemy Queen, but instead attack nearby enemy towers and break them down over time.<br>
                <br>
                A player needs to build a BARRACKS with his Queen in order to create creeps.<br>
                A Queen can establish a barracks on an obstacle by issuing the command BUILD BARRACKS {type} while touching an obstacle, for example: BUILD BARRACKS RANGED, or using the command BUILDONOBSTACLE {id} BARRACKS {type}  to move toward an obstacle and build a barracks when touching that obstacle.<br>
                Training creeps is explained in a section below.<br>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Towers</strong><br>
                <br>
                With enemy creeps hunting down the Queen, a player will be well-advised to create some static defense in the form of towers.<br>
                A Queen can establish a tower on an obstacle by issuing the command BUILD TOWER while touching an obstacle, or using the command BUILDONOBSTACLE {id} TOWER to move toward an obstacle and build a tower when touching that obstacle.<br>
                <br>
                The first such command will establish a small tower with a small firing radius.<br> A player can grow an existing tower by having the Queen stand next to it and issuing the same order again; this will increase the tower’s firing radius over several turns.<br>
                Once built, towers start to degrade slowly.<br>
                A tower will eventually degrade completely and be destroyed.<br>
                This can be delayed by regular visits by the Queen, and issuing the BUILD TOWER command again.<br>
                <br>
                Every turn, towers automatically fire upon the nearest enemy creep inside their firing radius, dealing 6-8 damage.<br>
                If there are no creeps in range, but the enemy Queen is in range, a tower will fire upon it instead, dealing 1 damage.<br>
                <br>
                If the enemy player is investing a lot of effort into towers, a player may wish to train GIANT creeps to knock them down.<br>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Training Creeps</strong><br>
                <br>
                Every obstacle is numbered, starting from 0.<br>
                A player trains creeps by indicating which numbered obstacles containing a barracks he wishes to train creeps at.<br>
                Examples:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>“TRAIN 13 6 19” - Three barracks begin training creeps</li>
                    <li>“TRAIN 14” - One barracks begins training creeps</li>
                    <li>“TRAIN” - No barracks begin training creeps.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Every barracks is built with the ability to train a single creep type.<br>
                When the train commands are sent, the player pays the total cost in resources, and indicated barracks will begin training the appropriate set of units.<br>
                After the appointed number of turns elapses, a set of creeps emerges from the barracks and begins acting by themselves on the next turn.<br>
                <br>
                A barracks that is already in the middle of training cannot begin training again until the current creep set is built.<br>
                Also, such a barracks cannot be replaced by another structure.<br>
