            <p><strong>Field</strong></p>

            <p>
                The game is played by two players on a field
                <const>1920</const>
                units wide and
                <const>1000</const>
                units high, littered with circular obstacles. The top-left corner is
                <const>0,0</const>
                .<br>
            </p>

            <!-- BEGIN wood3 wood2 -->
            <!-- END -->

            <p><strong>Queens</strong>

            <p>Each player controls a single Queen character, who can establish different structures on those obstacles.
            The Queen is the player’s only way to directly interact with the field.

            The Queen is modeled as a circle with radius <const>30</const> units, and moves up to <const>60</const> units every turn.<br>
            Each Queen starts with <const>200</const> HP, and will be destroyed if this drops to zero -- if this happens, the player will lose the game.<br>
            If both Queens are destroyed on the same turn, the game will end in a draw.<br>

            <p><strong>Structures</strong></p>

            <p>
                <br>
                A Queen character can build a structure on an obstacle that she is in contact with.<br>
                If she so chooses, a Queen can replace an existing friendly structure simply by building another one in its place (unless it is a Barracks that is currently training).<br>
                If an enemy Tower is already in place on an obstacle, a Queen cannot replace it.<br>
                Structures can be built at no cost. Towers and mines begin working the turn they are built, and can be
                grown over time.
                Barracks are available for use on the turn immediately following their construction.<br>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Mining</strong><br>
                <br>
                Each player begins with 100 gold. A player can increase the amount of gold collected per turn by
                building goldmines on obstacles.<br>
                <br>
                Each obstacle has a different rate at which gold can be collected, ranging from <const>+1</const>/turn to <const>+5</const>/turn.<br>
                When a mine is first built, it has an income rate of +1. This can be increased by issuing repeated commands to build a mine on the same obstacle, up to its maximum capacity.<br>
                Mines will automatically collect gold for the player each turn. However, the obstacle will be exhausted
                of gold over time.<br>
                Obstacles begin with different, random amounts of gold every game. Obstacles near the middle of the field have higher gold available, and higher maximum mining rates.<br>
                Gold totals and mining rates are not given for all obstacles, they must be discovered by the Queen. These numbers will be available for any
                obstacle whose center is within <const>300</const> units from the Queen.<br>
                <br>
                A mine will be destroyed if:
                <ul>
                    <li>It runs out of gold</li>
                    <li>An enemy creep or the enemy Queen comes in contact with it</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Creeps</strong><br>
                <br>
                In order to destroy the enemy Queen, a player will need to build creeps.<br>
                Once built, creeps follow very simple behaviours (see below), and cannot be controlled by the player.<br>
                Creeps will eventually age and die on their own, losing <const>1</const> HP every turn.<br>
                <br>
                There are three different creep types that can be built. <br>
                <br>
                MELEE units are light, fast units which attack the enemy Queen.<br>
                They cost
                <const>80</const>
                gold to train a group of 4.<br>
                <br>
                RANGED units are slower, ranged units which move toward and attack nearby enemy creeps from a short distance.<br>
                They cost
                <const>120</const>
                gold to train a group of 2. Note: RANGED units do not attack the enemy Queen!<br>
                <br>
                GIANT units do not attack the enemy Queen or enemy creeps, but instead attack nearby enemy towers and break them down over time.<br>
                They cost
                <const>140</const>
                gold to train a group of 1.
                <br>
                A player needs to build a BARRACKS with his Queen in order to create creeps.<br>
                A barracks can be destroyed if it is touched by the enemy Queen.<br>
                Training creeps is explained in a section below.<br><br>
            </p>


            <p><strong>Training Creeps</strong><br>
                <br>
                Every obstacle is numbered, starting from
                <const>0</const>
                .<br>
                A player trains creeps by indicating which numbered obstacles containing a barracks he wishes to train
                creeps at.<br>
                Examples:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>“TRAIN 13 6 19” - Three barracks begin training creeps</li>
                <li>“TRAIN 14” - One barracks begins training creeps</li>
                <li>“TRAIN” - No barracks begin training creeps.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Every barracks is built with the ability to train a single creep type.<br>
            When the train commands are sent, the player pays the total cost in gold, and indicated barracks will begin
            training the appropriate set of units.<br>
            After the appointed number of turns elapses, a set of creeps emerges from the barracks and begins acting by
            themselves on the following turn.<br>
            <br>
            A barracks that is already in the middle of training cannot begin training again until the current creep set
            is built.<br>
            Also, such a barracks cannot be replaced by another structure.<br>
            </p>


            <p><strong>Towers</strong></p>
            <p>
                The Queen can also build static defensive structures called Towers as defenses against enemy creeps.<br>
                <br>
                When a tower is first built, it has a small firing radius.<br>
                A player can grow an existing tower by having the Queen stand next to it and issuing the same order
                again; this will increase the tower’s firing radius over several turns.<br>
                Once built, towers start to degrade slowly. A tower will eventually degrade completely and be destroyed.<br>
                This can be delayed by regular visits by the Queen, and issuing the BUILD TOWER command again.<br>
                <br>
                If there are no creeps in range, but the enemy Queen is in range, a tower will fire upon her
                instead.<br>
            </p>
